For every script, command, or workflow you generate in this repo, you MUST:

1. Explain **exactly how to run it safely**
   - Which directory to run from
   - Any required environment variables, tools, or pre-steps
2. Describe **what successful execution looks like**
   - Sample console output, logs, created files, or visible UI changes
3. Clearly flag anything that has **not actually been executed** as:
