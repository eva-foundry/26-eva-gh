R1: Prompt injection leading to disclosure of Protected B or PII
- Asset/Component: Backend prompt-processing, Azure OpenAI calls (backend/, Dockerfile.backend)
- Vulnerability: Unvalidated user-provided content included in prompts; lack of redaction/minimization; absence of input/output moderation.
- Likelihood: High
- Impact: High (exfiltration of Protected B)
- Inherent Risk: High
- Mitigations:
  - Implement strict input validation and PII redaction prior to model calls (code-level filters).
  - Use prompt engineering to add explicit 'do not reveal' constraints and system messages.
  - Apply model-side moderation APIs and post-response filters; block or human-review sensitive outputs.
  - Log correlation IDs and maintain prompt-output audit trail in secure store with restricted access (Key Vault + encrypted storage).
  - Rate-limit and anomaly-detect high-volume or pattern-based exfiltration attempts.
- Residual Risk: Medium (depends on human-in-loop coverage and moderation efficacy)
- Owner: Dev / Security
- Priority: P0
- Evidence required: code showing redaction, moderation logs, DAST/pentest findings related to prompt injection, monitoring rules.

R2: Model hallucination producing inaccurate or misleading public-sector guidance
- Asset/Component: Azure OpenAI output presented to users (frontend/, backend/)
- Vulnerability: No source attribution, lack of grounding to trusted knowledge base, no human review for critical responses.
- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: Medium to High (depends on use-case and reliance)
- Inherent Risk: Medium
- Mitigations:
  - Ground responses with references from validated knowledge sources and include citations.
  - Add confidence scoring and indicate when content is AI-generated; require human review for policy/legal guidance.
  - Implement guardrails that flag high-risk topics and route to subject-matter experts.
- Residual Risk: Low-Medium
- Owner: Product / Privacy
- Priority: P1
- Evidence required: code showing citations, logs of human review flows, UI disclaimers, PIA entries.

R3: Unauthorized access due to weak IAM or leaked secrets

Risk scoring notes
- Likelihood: High / Medium / Low (based on exploitability and exposure)
- Impact: High / Medium / Low (based on data sensitivity and operational impact)
- Inherent Risk derived from combination of Likelihood and Impact
- Residual Risk assumes mitigations listed are implemented; owners must update after implementation and testing.

AI-specific threat modeling considerations
- Prompt injection & data exfiltration are high-priority unique risks.
- Model integrity and hallucinations require operational mitigations (grounding, human-in-loop)
- Traceability: store prompts and outputs securely with correlation IDs for forensic analysis, but balance with privacy redaction requirements.

AI threat taxonomy (cross-reference SECURITY-SYSTEM-PROFILE Section 4.6)
- LLM01 Prompt Injection & Jailbreaking: malicious inputs override system instructions, cause data exfiltration
  - Mitigations: input validation, content filters, policy prompts, human-in-loop for sensitive actions
- LLM02 Model Integrity Risks: training data poisoning, corrupted embeddings, compromised model endpoints
  - Mitigations: provenance checks, whitelist sources, monitor model/version integrity, vendor attestation
- LLM03 Privacy Risks: model memorization and leakage of PII to provider or via outputs
  - Mitigations: PII redaction (Presidio), minimization, contractual DPA, differential privacy (where applicable)
- LLM04 Availability Threats: token/resource exhaustion, API rate-limit abuse, DoS on inference endpoints
  - Mitigations: quotas, WAF, autoscaling, anomaly detection for excessive token usage
- LLM05 Supply Chain Risks: third-party model/provider dependency, vendor lock-in, unpinned actions/images
  - Mitigations: SBOM/SCA, image signing (cosign), pinned actions, multi-vendor strategy

Cross-border data flow risks (SECURITY-SYSTEM-PROFILE Section 9.4.5)
- Threat: Protected B data or derived artifacts processed in non-Canadian regions (OpenAI USA endpoints)
- Likelihood: Medium-High (configuration drift or misrouted traffic)
- Impact: High (data sovereignty breach)
- Mitigations: Use Azure OpenAI in Canada regions only, enforce geofencing and private endpoints, audit endpoints
- Residual Risk: Low-Medium (pending CIO risk acceptance if non-Canadian processing is necessary)

Multi-tenancy risks
- Cross-tenant data leakage via improper header validation (`X-Tenant-ID`), shared caches (Redis), or misconfigured collections (Qdrant)
- Mitigations: strict tenant scoping in code paths, isolation via prefixes/collections, authenticated Redis, tests in DAST
- Residual Risk: Medium until automated tests and code reviews validate isolation consistently

RBAC alignment (SECURITY-SYSTEM-PROFILE Section 5.3)
- Ensure 7 roles enforce least privilege across ingestion, query, admin, audit operations
- Risk: over-privileged roles enabling data modification or deletion by non-admins
- Mitigations: enforce permission matrix in code, periodic access reviews, unit/integration tests for role checks

Next steps (actionable)
1. Owners to confirm or replace ASSUMPTION entries and assign named owners.
2. Create mitigation tickets for all P0 items and track in project tracker.
3. Run DAST/SAST/SCA and add evidence to docs/ folder per SECURITY-ASSESSMENTS.md roadmap.
4. Initiate PIA/PADI and TRA activities and collect artifacts.
5. Schedule pen test after remediations of P0 findings.

Appendix: How to use this file
- Add rows or entries following the table template above. Keep a living risk register by updating Likelihood/Impact after mitigation and noting evidence links (docs/ or issue URLs).
