## Executive Summary

This document maps the PubSec Information Assistant solution to the mandatory Security Assessment & Authorization (SA&A) artifacts required for an ITSG-33 / NIST SP 800-53 aligned Authority to Operate (ATO) and Privacy Assessment and Design Integration (PADI) submission.

The PubSec Information Assistant is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for public sector use, integrating Azure OpenAI services for LLM-based query answering with enterprise-grade multi-tenancy, security controls, and compliance features. This document references the System Security Profile established in the repository's compliance documentation (see [SOC2-COMPLIANCE.md](./compliance/SOC2-COMPLIANCE.md) and [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)) and identifies the specific assessments, artifacts, evidence, and gaps that must be addressed prior to ATO approval.

**Key Integration Points:**
- **Azure OpenAI**: LLM inference and embeddings (GPT-4, text-embedding-ada-002)
- **Entra ID / Managed Identities**: Authentication and authorization
- **Container-Based Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes orchestration
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Tenant-isolated data, cache, and network policies

**Document Scope:**  
This guide provides actionable requirements for IT Security assessors and privacy reviewers to collect evidence, execute tests, and identify gaps for ATO/PADI readiness.
