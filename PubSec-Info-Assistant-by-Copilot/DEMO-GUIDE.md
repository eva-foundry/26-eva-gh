## Demo Script

### Part 1: Document Ingestion (3 minutes)

**Narrative**: "First, let's ingest some public sector documents into the system. We support PDF, DOCX, HTML, and TXT formats."

#### 1.1 Create Sample Documents
```bash
# Create a sample document directory
mkdir -p demo-documents

# Create sample cybersecurity document
cat > demo-documents/nist-framework.txt << 'EOF'
NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a policy framework of computer security guidance for how private sector organizations can assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks.

Core Functions:
1. Identify - Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk
2. Protect - Implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services
3. Detect - Implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event
4. Respond - Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident
5. Recover - Maintain plans for resilience and restore capabilities

The framework is organized into five concurrent and continuous Functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. When considered together, these Functions provide a high-level, strategic view of the lifecycle of an organization's management of cybersecurity risk.

# Create FISMA compliance document
cat > demo-documents/fisma-requirements.txt << 'EOF'
FISMA Compliance Requirements

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for the information and systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.

Key Requirements:
1. Risk Assessment - Conduct annual risk assessments
2. Security Controls - Implement NIST 800-53 security controls
3. Continuous Monitoring - Monitor security controls on an ongoing basis
4. Incident Response - Establish incident response capabilities
5. Contingency Planning - Develop business continuity plans

FISMA compliance is mandatory for all federal agencies and contractors who process federal data. Non-compliance can result in penalties and loss of federal contracts.

# Create cloud security document
cat > demo-documents/cloud-security.txt << 'EOF'
Cloud Security Best Practices for Government

Public sector organizations moving to cloud infrastructure must address several security considerations:

Authentication and Access Control:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit privileges
- Enable audit logging for all access attempts

Data Protection:
- Encrypt data at rest using AES-256
- Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.3
- Implement key management using FIPS 140-2 validated modules

Compliance:
- FedRAMP authorization for cloud service providers
- Continuous monitoring and assessment
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

Cloud providers must maintain SOC 2 Type II certification and demonstrate compliance with federal security standards.

#### 1.2 Ingest Documents via API
```bash
# Ingest NIST Framework document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ingest \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" \
  -F "file=@demo-documents/nist-framework.txt"

# Wait 2 seconds
sleep 2

# Ingest FISMA document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ingest \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" \
  -F "file=@demo-documents/fisma-requirements.txt"

sleep 2

# Ingest Cloud Security document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ingest \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" \
  -F "file=@demo-documents/cloud-security.txt"
```

Expected output (per document):
```json
{
  "document_id": "doc-abc123",
  "filename": "nist-framework.txt",
  "chunks_created": 3,
  "processing_time_ms": 1247,
  "tenant_id": "demo-agency",
  "status": "success"
}
```

#### 1.3 Verify Collection Statistics
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/collection/stats \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" | jq
```

**Talking Point**: "The system has chunked these documents into smaller segments, generated embeddings using OpenAI's ada-002 model, and stored them in our Qdrant vector database with tenant isolation."

---

### Part 2: Query Processing (5 minutes)

**Narrative**: "Now let's query the system. The RAG pipeline will retrieve relevant chunks, generate an answer using GPT-4, and cite sources."

#### 2.1 Query 1: Cybersecurity Requirements
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" \
  -G --data-urlencode "query=What are the core cybersecurity requirements for federal agencies?" \
  -d "top_k=5" \
  -d "use_cache=true" | jq
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "query": "What are the core cybersecurity requirements for federal agencies?",
  "answer": "Federal agencies must comply with FISMA, which requires implementing NIST 800-53 security controls [Doc 2], conducting annual risk assessments, and establishing continuous monitoring capabilities. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework [Doc 1] provides five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.",
  "citations": [
    {
      "document_id": "doc-abc123",
      "chunk_id": "chunk-1",
      "title": "nist-framework.txt",
      "content": "Core Functions: 1. Identify - Develop an organizational understanding...",
      "relevance_score": 0.92,
      "source_url": null
    },
    {
      "document_id": "doc-def456",
      "chunk_id": "chunk-2",
      "title": "fisma-requirements.txt",
      "content": "Key Requirements: 1. Risk Assessment - Conduct annual risk assessments...",
      "relevance_score": 0.88
    }
  ],
  "retrieval_results": 5,
  "cost": 0.00007,
  "tokens_used": {
    "input": 512,
    "output": 98,
    "total": 610
  },
  "tenant_balance": 999.99993,
  "processing_time_ms": 347,
  "cached": false
}
```

**Talking Points**:
- "Notice the answer cites specific documents [Doc 1], [Doc 2]"
- "Cost tracking: $0.00007 for this query"
- "Processing time: 347ms (under 500ms SLA)"
- "Tenant balance updated in real-time"

#### 2.2 Query 2: Cloud Security (Demonstrates Caching)
```bash
# First query
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" \
  -G --data-urlencode "query=What are the authentication requirements for cloud security?" \
  -d "use_cache=true" | jq '.processing_time_ms, .cached'

# Same query again (should hit cache)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" \
  -G --data-urlencode "query=What are the authentication requirements for cloud security?" \
  -d "use_cache=true" | jq '.processing_time_ms, .cached, .cost'
```

Expected output:
```
First query:  347ms, cached: false
Second query: 12ms, cached: true, cost: 0.0
```

**Talking Point**: "The second query is 97% faster and costs nothing because it's served from Redis cache. Our SLA targets >70% cache hit rate."

#### 2.3 Query 3: Multi-Tenant Isolation
```bash
# Query from Agency A
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: agency-a" \
  -G --data-urlencode "query=What is FISMA?" | jq '.retrieval_results'

# Query from Agency B (different tenant, no data)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: agency-b" \
  -G --data-urlencode "query=What is FISMA?" | jq '.retrieval_results, .answer'
```

**Talking Point**: "Agency B gets no results because we enforce strict tenant isolation. Each agency's data is completely segregated at the vector database, cache, and API layers."

#### 2.4 Query 4: Complex Multi-Document Query
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" \
  -G --data-urlencode "query=How do NIST, FISMA, and FedRAMP requirements relate to cloud security compliance?" \
  -d "top_k=10" | jq
```

**Talking Point**: "The system synthesizes information from multiple documents and provides a coherent answer with proper citations."

### Part 5: Production Features (2 minutes)

#### 5.1 Health & Readiness Checks
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health | jq

# Readiness check
curl http://localhost:8000/ready | jq
```

#### 5.2 Rate Limiting
```bash
# Rapid fire 150 requests (exceeds 100/min limit)
for i in {1..150}; do
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query" \
    -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" \
    -G --data-urlencode "query=test$i" &
done
wait

# Check for rate limit errors (429 status)
```

**Expected**: First 100 requests succeed, remaining 50 get 429 rate limit exceeded

#### 5.3 Tenant Statistics
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tenant/stats \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: demo-agency" | jq
```

Output:
